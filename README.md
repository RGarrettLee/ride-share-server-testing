# Ride Compare

## A website to use to compare prices between ride sharing apps

Have you every used Uber or Lyft and thought to yourself, "This seems so expensive for this ride, I wonder if can use another app to save money?" Well, you've come to the right place.

Due to the nature of ride sharing services, they will have surge pricing which means the price of a ride can drastically vary between different apps and services.

Our website solves this issue for you by providing the information about any given ride across all of the apps with their included surge pricing to let you make the most informed decision about which app to use.

> **Note:** due to Uber and Lyft closing off their API to the public, an alternative solution was used to gather data and therefore the website is a bit slow and has some bugs, Please bear with us however
